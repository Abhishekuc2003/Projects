This repository contains a collection of **core electronics and embedded systems projects** focused on practical hardware implementation and real-world applications.

The projects demonstrate hands-on experience with **microcontrollers, sensors, and communication protocols**, emphasizing **electronics fundamentals and embedded system design** rather than high-level software development.

### Key Areas Covered

* Microcontroller-based system design (STM32, ESP32, Arduino)
* Embedded C / C++ programming
* Sensor interfacing and real-time data processing
* UART, I2C, SPI, and MQTT communication
* Hardware–software integration and debugging

This repository serves as a technical showcase for **embedded systems, electronics, and IoT-focused roles**.
